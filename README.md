# UnityParrot - XInput Handler


This fork allows the usage of controllers for Ongeki. 
The Contoller has to use DirectX for example the Xbox 360 Controller.
While the mouse isn't being used, the keyboard is used to scan the Aime card (F2). 

This fork uses the DirectX API by speps: https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet
